# Event-Driven Patterns

Patterns for handling signals, updates, and event-driven workflows.

- [Signal with Start](signal-with-start.md) - Start workflow or signal if already running
- [Request-Response via Updates](request-response-via-updates.md) - Synchronous state modification with validation
- [Updatable Timer](updatable-timer.md) - Dynamic timer that can be extended or shortened
