# Stateful / Lifecycle Patterns

Patterns for managing workflow state and lifecycle.

- [Entity Workflow](entity-workflow.md) - Models long-lived business entities as individual workflows
- [Request-Response via Updates](request-response-via-updates.md) - Synchronous state modification with validation
- [Continue-As-New](continue-as-new.md) - Prevents unbounded history growth
- [Child Workflows](child-workflows.md) - Decomposes complex workflows into smaller units
